## Introduction

This repository contains CAN signal database (DBC) files used in various
Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) demonstrations.

## agl-vcar.dbc

This DBC file defines a minimal set of CAN signals representing a virtual car.
Note that any changes need to take into account that many of the signals are
mapped to Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) signals in various AGL demos.
